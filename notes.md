# Motivation

Something like Notion, but local (not cloud) and more flexible (customizable through/in code).


# Future

* Use TypeScript typechecking in browser? - has an API: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API
* Style-/Theme-Editor?
    * Customizable CSS, always under a specific new class, divisible into sections and with live example html preview
    * Or just a kind of WYSIWYG interface for tailwindcss
* Change (Context) Menus to "Commander Prompts"
    * Mixture of Sublime's/Atom's/VSCode's "Command Palette", Notion's Context Menus/Commands and iOS's long press "Context Menu"s/Previews
* PWA
* REPL
    * console-feed?
* Collaboration?
    * yJS

* Other Code Editor?
    - monaco? (~VSCode) https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor
